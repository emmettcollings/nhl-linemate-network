Here you will find all the information you need to embark upon your group project.

## Getting started

Here is a link for the Project Matchmaking google sheets - complete this by the end of Week 1:

Ideally you will work in pairs, though threes are also ok. Self-organise by reaching out to unpartnered people with complementary skillsets. Try to find someone different to you; together you will be more than the sum of your parts.

Refer to the project proposal files, noting the deadline is Tuesday September 27th for your proposals. Email the instructor and TAs a pdf of your presentation an hour before class, 8:30am. Time will be extremely tight so we need all your slides on one device. Submit your written proposal by 11:59pm Calgary time via the D2L Dropbox. This does give you an opportunity to sneak in minor edits based on feedback from your presentation, but you cannot completely overhaul it.

You should also complete a group contract as soon as you have formed your pair/small team. This will set expectations and promote effective collaboration. Upload this file along with your project proposal to the D2L Dropbox.

Each group member should upload project files to the Dropbox (yes, that causes duplicates, but it makes managing grading marginally easier for us).

## Data Sources

You may use any dataset that you have the permissions and expertise to access, and that is NOT already in a network format. You can use APIs (e.g. https://www.flickr.com/services/api/), scrape data yourself if you have the technical expertise, or refer to a data repository. Here are some helpful resources to help you with your search. The links below mostly point to Open Data sources:

- https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
- [Open Calgary](https://data.calgary.ca/) (City of Calgary open data portal)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (searchable)
- [Github public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) (categorized by subject)
- [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) (currently in beta but quite useful)
- [Data Sources for Data Science](https://library.ucalgary.ca/c.php?g=704953&p=5016063) (UCalgary Library Guide for the Data Science program)
- You cannot use these (they are in network format already), but you may be inspired:
