abstract = {In this paper, we model a recent legal case as presented in a court of first instance using argument schemes and an argumentation framework, providing a formal analysis of the case and how the outcome was determined. The paper contributes to the body of literature that formally analyses legal cases in terms of arguments and argument schemes. It is novel in that we analyse a case in a court of first instance, so we have arguments about facts, qualifications of intermediate predicates, and the application of legal rules. We show the importance of undercutters in relating principles to the specific case.},
